## Key Value Drivers

### 1. Business Context Integration

```yaml
# Add business context to technical metrics
transform/business_context:
  statements:
    - set(attributes["business.revenue_per_query"], 
          attributes["business_impact_score"] * 
          attributes["customer.transaction_value"])
```

### 2. Intelligent Correlation

```yaml
# Multi-signal correlation for root cause
transform/correlation:
  statements:
    - set(attributes["rootcause.score"], 
          attributes["anomaly_score"] * 
          attributes["correlation.strength"] * 
          attributes["business_impact"])
```

### 3. Predictive Analytics

```yaml
# Forecast future issues
transform/predictive:
  statements:
    - set(attributes["failure.probability"], 
          predictLinear(attributes["resource.usage"], 3600))
```

## Dashboard Design Principles

### 1. Information Hierarchy
```
Executive Summary (1 screen)
  ↓
Operational Intelligence (drill-down)
  ↓
Technical Deep Dive (investigation)
  ↓
Automated Actions (resolution)
```

### 2. Visual Optimization
- **Traffic Lights**: Red/Yellow/Green for instant status
- **Trend Sparklines**: Quick performance indicators
- **Heat Maps**: Pattern recognition
- **Dependency Graphs**: Relationship visualization

### 3. Action-Oriented Layout
- Left: Current state
- Center: Root cause analysis
- Right: Recommended actions

## Advanced Features

### 1. Dynamic Baselines

```yaml
# Adaptive baseline calculation
transform/dynamic_baseline:
  statements:
    - set(attributes["baseline.adaptive"], 
          Case(
            DayOfWeek(Now()) IN (1,7), attributes["baseline.weekend"],
            Hour(Now()) < 9, attributes["baseline.offhours"],
            attributes["baseline.business"]
          ))
```

### 2. Cost Attribution

```yaml
# Query cost calculation
transform/cost_attribution:
  statements:
    - set(attributes["cost.total"], 
          attributes["cpu.cost"] + 
          attributes["io.cost"] + 
          attributes["memory.cost"])
```

### 3. SLA Impact Scoring

```yaml
# SLA violation prediction
transform/sla_impact:
  statements:
    - set(attributes["sla.violation_risk"], 
          Case(
            attributes["latency.p99"] > attributes["sla.threshold"] * 0.8, "high",
            attributes["latency.p99"] > attributes["sla.threshold"] * 0.6, "medium",
            "low"
          ))
```
